# Logger Pro Data Viewer
A program to view position, velocity and acceleration graphs from Logger Pro CMBL Files

Class projects may require the use of Logger Pro for some labs or other experiments but the program is costly and not needed to simply look at the data. This program allows logger pro files to be opened and viewed. Eventually graphs can be exported or copied to the clipboard.

Work in progress

Feel free to contribute! Contact me at wreed58@gmail.com if you have questions or need help

To Do:
- Upon opening program, prompt user to select file
- Fix acceleration graph
- Show average slopes on the lines (not displacement graph)
- Allow graphs to be exported / copied to clipboard
- Allow graphs to be printed

Possible Future Additions
- Plot points from a video right in the program
- Use other types of data in the program (temperature etc)
- Edit data in the program
- View tables of the data being used
- Change units
