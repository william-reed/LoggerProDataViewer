# LoggerProDataViewer
A program to view position, velocity and acceleration graphs from Logger Pro CMBL Files

Class projects may require the use of Logger Pro for some labs or other experiments but the program is costly and not needed to simply look at the data. This program allows logger pro files to be opened and viewed. Eventually graphs can be exported or copied to the clipboard.
